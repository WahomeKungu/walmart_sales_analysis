I analyze walmart sales dataset using SQL. I create the database and load the data.
The analysis is in three phases: Feature Engineering, General Questions and Sales Analysis.
Feature Engineering creates new columns from the data to gain deeper insights from the data.
General Questions help us get an overview of the data and answer questions about Walmart
Sales Analysis takes a dive into the nature of sales, trends and any patterns in the sales.
